AT&T Technical Assessment
By Alvin Alaphat

Input Description: I took the second input option that was shown in the assessment description which is demonstrated below in the input format section. It takes a multi-line string input which is important because it parses it based on new line characters.

Input format: 

Spike,1/1/2020,white,dog
Sandy,3/5/2018,blue,cat
Fluffy,2/29/2016,black,sheep
Garfield,9/17/1998,orange,cat

Output Description: The code checks which animal is the most common, and in this example, there are more cats than any other animal and then it searches for the oldest cat based on the birth date and returns it's name, color, species, and sound in the format demonstrated below in the output format section.

Output format:

Garfield, the orange cat says meow!


Thanks for the opportunity to do this!
